  <h2>{{ $user->username }},</h2>
  <p style="font-size:14px;">Wow, it's been about a month since we redesigned Yeayur and relaunched. All of us here at Yeayur want to thank you for signing up and trying out the network. We are very thankful you gave us a chance. We truly believe that a network built to leverage the viewer's perspective can be very insightful in helping you learn what your viewers are thinking. <span style="color:#ff3300;font-weight:bold">Remember, you get more value by telling your viewers about your Yeayur profile so they can give you feedback!</span></p>
  <p style="font-size:14px;">In case you haven't spent a lot of time looking through the website, here's a rundown of our features and a brief explanation about them. <b>Always feel free to give us suggestions on what you would like to see on the site!</b></p>
  <h4 style="color:#ff3300;border-bottom:1px solid #e3e3e3;padding-bottom:15px;">First off, we just pushed a new update that gives you the ability to receive email notifications whenever someone posts on your profile. You can set your preference by clicking the menu icon at the top-right of your Feedback board!</h4>
  <h4>Your Profile - <span style="font-weight:initial;">This is everything about you which we import mostly from your Twitch profile including your picture, bio, videos, and image.</span></h4>
  <h5 style="padding-left:10px;">Top Profile Visits - <span style="font-weight:initial;">This shows whom you have most frequently visited which helps users find each other better.</span></h5>
  <h5 style="padding-left:10px;">What I Stream - <span style="font-weight:initial;">This is where you can enter a detailed description of yourself and what you stream and format it however you want.</span></h5>
  <h5 style="padding-left:10px;">Videos - <span style="font-weight:initial;">If you have enabled Videos on Demand on Twitch, we will link the 5 most recent videos here so users can view your stream while you're offline.</span></h5>
  <h5 style="padding-left:10px;">Streamer Tags - <span style="font-weight:initial;">Tag a streamer with whatever you want. All tags are searchable to find both profiles and Fan Pages. Remember, you cannot tag yourself, only your viewers can tag you.</span></h5>
  <h5 style="padding-left:10px;">Your Stream - <span style="font-weight:initial;">We import your stream directly from Twitch so you can be viewed live from Yeayur, but also we link your Twitch profile so users can quickly navigate to your Twitch profile.</span></h5>
  <h5 style="padding-left:10px;">Feedback Board - <span style="font-weight:initial;">This is where you receive content from your viewers. Remember, you don't have the ability to post unless it's a reply to previous content on your board.</span></h5>
  <h4>Fan Page - <span style="font-weight:initial;">Anyone can create a Fan Page for a streamer that's not yet registered. If that streamer registers, we automatically transfer over all posts, tags, and followers to that new profile.</span></h4>
  <h4>Reputation System - <span style="font-weight:initial;">This was built with the idea to reward streamers with reputation points for being active. Users can then upvote or downvote another user's feedback which also increases or decreases their reputation. We then give the top contributors more exposure on the main page. <span style="font-weight:bold">(This is still being optimized)</span></span></h4>
  <h4 style="border-bottom:1px solid #e3e3e3;padding-bottom:15px;">Main Page - <span style="font-weight:initial;">This reflects all community activity such as new profiles, fan pages, top contributors, and recent posts.</span></h4>
  <h5>We will continue to build out the network to make it even more valuable to streamers like yourself.</h5>
  <h4>Thank you for being part of the Yeayur community!</h4>
